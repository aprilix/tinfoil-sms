DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------

*This is a BETA release of the application, please use Tinfoil-SMS at your own discretion.*

You can never be sure who or what is viewing your messages or what they’re going to do with them if they should get them. Tinfoil-SMS is an encrypted messaging application so your texts don’t fall into the wrong hands. Tinfoil-SMS uses 256 bit ECC public keys as well as a unique signed key exchange to prevent any “man-in-the-middle” attacks.

The only way an unwanted party will see your messages is if they know your secret passphrases and trick you into accepting a key exchange from them. If you think we’re bluffing or you need to see it to believe it, feel free to poke around the source code. It’s open source and we’ve got nothing to hide.
