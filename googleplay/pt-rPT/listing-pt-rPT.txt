DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------

*This is a BETA release of the application, please use Tinfoil-SMS at your own discretion.*
How can you be sure that your messages are secure? Fact is you can’t, however with Tinfoil-SMS you can be sure they’re reaching the right person and not a prying government agency or your reclusive nextdoor neighbor.

Tinfoil-SMS is an encrypted messaging application built to ensure your texts don’t fall into the wrong hands. It uses 256 bit ECC public keys as well as a unique signed key exchange to prevent any “man-in-the-middle” attacks. With Tinfoil-SMS, the only way an unwanted party will see your messages is if they know your secret passphrases or steal your phone. If you need to see it to believe it, feel free to poke around the source code. It’s open source and we’ve got nothing to hide.
