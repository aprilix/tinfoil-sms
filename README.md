Tinfoil-SMS
========================================

## What is Tinfoil-SMS

You can never be sure who or what is viewing your messages or what they’re going 
to do with them if they should get them. Tinfoil-SMS is an encrypted messaging 
application so your texts don’t fall into the wrong hands. Tinfoil-SMS uses 256 
bit ECC public keys as well as a unique signed key exchange to prevent any 
“man-in-the-middle” attacks.


## Get Tinfoil-SMS

You can get the latest release of Tinfoil-SMS from the 
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinfoil.sms), 
please see the project [Github page](http://tinfoilhat.github.io/tinfoil-sms/) 
for the relevant download URLs and screenshots of the application. Or if you 
prefer, you can get a copy of the latest code from the master branch, feel free 
to submit pull requests for any contributions you would like to make.


## Guiding Principles

1. The worst security is a false sense of security
2. The best security is the appearance of no security
3. Design systems with the intent that everyone is acting against the system
4. Security above all else, including performance


## Project Goals

* Always free for anyone to use and with no limitations
* Released as Open Source software under the GNU General Public License Version 3
* Simple to use and understand UI
* Easy to import contacts from the phone to Tinfoil-SMS
* Public key cryptography using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
* A secure and reliable public key signing scheme to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks
* AES-256 block cipher with SHA-256 message HMAC
* Incorporate steganography to obfuscate text messages
* Comprehensive source code documentation and wiki
* Thorough guide to help mitigate any security risks as a result of improper use


## Future Plans

* Security audits and a detailed cryptanalysis of the application and the library, [Orwell](https://github.com/gnu-user/Orwell)
* Finalizing the cryptography during the beta release, so that it can remain unchanged for the stable release
* A stable release within 6 months of the beta release
* Incorporating steganography to obfuscate text messages for the next major release
